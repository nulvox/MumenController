   cargo objcopy --release -- -O ihex mumen-controller.hex
   ```

5. Open Teensy Loader, load the hex file, and press the button on Teensy 4.0 to flash

## Configuration

The Mumen Controller firmware uses a compile-time configuration system for maximum performance with zero runtime overhead. All configuration is done through TOML files.

### Button Mapping (Pinout)

Edit `config/pinout/default.toml` to map buttons to Teensy 4.0 pins:

```toml
# Digital inputs
[digital]
button_a = 2       # A button on pin 2
button_b = 3       # B button on pin 3
button_x = 4       # X button on pin 4
button_y = 5       # Y button on pin 5
button_l = 6       # L button on pin 6
button_r = 7       # R button on pin 7
button_zl = 8      # ZL button on pin 8
button_zr = 9      # ZR button on pin 9
button_plus = 10   # Plus button on pin 10
button_minus = 11  # Minus button on pin 11
button_home = 12   # Home button on pin 12
button_capture = 14 # Capture button on pin 14
button_l3 = 15     # Left stick press on pin 15
button_r3 = 16     # Right stick press on pin 16
dpad_up = 17       # D-pad Up on pin 17
dpad_down = 18     # D-pad Down on pin 18
dpad_left = 19     # D-pad Left on pin 19
dpad_right = 20    # D-pad Right on pin 20

# Analog inputs
[analog]
left_stick_x = 23  # Left stick X-axis on pin 23 (A10)
left_stick_y = 22  # Left stick Y-axis on pin 22 (A9)
right_stick_x = 21 # Right stick X-axis on pin 21 (A8)
right_stick_y = 20 # Right stick Y-axis on pin 20 (A7)

# Special functionality
[special]
lock_pin = 33      # Lock functionality on pin 33
```

**Important Notes:**
- Any button or input not listed in the configuration will be automatically disabled
- The pin numbers correspond to the Teensy 4.0 pin numbering scheme
- Analog inputs must be connected to analog-capable pins (check your Teensy 4.0 documentation)
- Digital inputs are read as active-low by default (button press connects pin to ground)

### SOCD Handling

Edit `config/socd/default.toml` to configure how contradictory inputs (like pressing left+right simultaneously) are resolved:

```toml
[resolution_methods]
left_right = "neutral"   # Left + Right = neutral
up_down = "up-priority"  # Up + Down = Up takes priority

[custom_overrides]
# Custom overrides for specific game situations
# "left+down" = "down-left" # Example
```

Available SOCD resolution methods:
- `"neutral"`: Both directions are turned off (Left+Right = center)
- `"last-win"`: The last input pressed takes priority
- `"first-win"`: The first input pressed takes priority
- `"up-priority"`: Up takes priority over down (only for up/down)
- `"second-input-priority"`: Second directional input overrides the first

### Custom Configurations

You can create multiple configuration profiles by adding new TOML files:

1. Create custom configs:
   - `config/pinout/custom.toml`
   - `config/socd/custom.toml`

2. Select which config to use at build time:
   ```
   # Use custom pinout
   PINOUT_CONFIG=custom cargo build --release
   
   # Use custom SOCD configuration
   SOCD_CONFIG=custom cargo build --release
   
   # Use both custom configs
   PINOUT_CONFIG=custom SOCD_CONFIG=custom cargo build --release
   ```

All configuration is processed at compile time, resulting in zero runtime overhead.

## LED Blink Patterns

The firmware uses different LED blink patterns on the Teensy 4.0's onboard LED (pin 13) to indicate various error conditions. These patterns help diagnose issues when troubleshooting:

| Error Type    | Blink Pattern                   | Description                        |
|---------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Hard Fault    | Rapid blinks (5Hz)             | Core ARM processor fault           |
| Memory Error  | Long-short-short               | Memory allocation/pointer error     |
| USB Error     | Long-short-long                | USB communication issue             |
| Init Error    | Continuous ON                  | Hardware initialization failure     |
| Config Error  | Short-long-short               | Invalid configuration               |
| Other/Unknown | SOS pattern (...---...)        | Unspecified error                   |

**Blink Pattern Details:**
- **Long blink**: LED on for 600ms, off for 200ms
- **Short blink**: LED on for 200ms, off for 200ms
- **Rapid blinks**: LED on for 100ms, off for 100ms (5Hz)
- **SOS pattern**: 3 short blinks, 3 long blinks, 3 short blinks, followed by a 1-second pause
- **Continuous ON**: LED remains constantly lit

## Key Components

### USB HID Implementation

The firmware implements the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller HID descriptor and communication protocol:

- **Report Format**: Based on the Switch Pro Controller's USB HID descriptor
  - 2 bytes for 16 buttons
  - 1 byte for HAT switch (first nibble) and another nibble
  - 4 bytes for joystick data
  - 1 byte for vendor-specific data
  - 8 bytes for output data

- **USB Communication**:
  - 1000Hz polling rate for minimal latency
  - Proper handling of control requests from the Switch
  - Correct vendor and product IDs for Switch Pro Controller emulation
  - Enhanced state monitoring and error detection
  - Automatic recovery from connection issues

### Input Handling System

The input handling system processes both digital and analog inputs:

- **Digital Input Processing**:
  - Reads GPIO pin states based on pinout configuration
  - Applies debouncing to ensure clean, reliable button inputs
  - Maps physical inputs to logical controller buttons

- **Analog Input Processing**:
  - Reads analog values from designated pins
  - Applies filtering and normalization
  - Maps analog values to joystick ranges expected by the Switch

- **SOCD Handling**:
  - Resolves contradictory inputs (like pressing left+right simultaneously)
  - Configurable resolution methods (neutral, priority, etc.)
  - Applied to both D-pad and analog stick inputs when needed

- **Lock Pin Functionality**:
  - When activated, prevents specific buttons (Home, Plus, Minus, Capture) from being registered
  - Helps avoid accidental menu activation during gameplay
  - Configurable via the pinout configuration

### Configuration System

The configuration system is 100% compile-time with zero runtime overhead:

- **Build Script Processing**:
  - `build.rs` reads TOML configuration files during compilation
  - Generates Rust code with constants based on these configurations
  - Allows selection of different configurations via environment variables

- **Generated Code**:
  - Creates constants for each input's presence and pin mapping
  - Encodes SOCD handling rules as compile-time constants
  - Results in optimized code with no runtime configuration overhead

- **Flexibility**:
  - Multiple configuration profiles can be created
  - Any undefined input is automatically disabled
  - Custom configurations can be selected at build time

### Panic Handler

The panic handler provides visual feedback when errors occur:

- **LED-Based Error Reporting**:
  - Different blink patterns for different error types
  - Helps diagnose issues without additional equipment
  - See [LED Blink Patterns](#led-blink-patterns) for details

- **Error Type Detection**:
  - Automatically infers error type from panic message
  - Categorizes errors into specific types for easier debugging
  - Provides meaningful feedback for common issues

## Future Extensions

The architecture allows for future enhancements:
